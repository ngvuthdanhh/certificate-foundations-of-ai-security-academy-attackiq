# 🔍 Module 2 – AI/ML Attack Surface

## AI/ML Attack Vectors
- **Data poisoning** – Corrupting training data to influence model behavior.
- **Model evasion** – Manipulating inputs to bypass detection.
- **Model extraction/stealing** – Reverse engineering model functionality.
- **Backdoor attacks** – Hidden triggers in training data.

## Key Insight
The attack surface grows as AI integrates into cloud, APIs, and real-time decision-making.
