# 🛡️ Module 4 – Defensive Strategies

## Defenses
- **Data sanitization** – Filtering and validating training data.
- **Robust training** – Using adversarial training methods.
- **Monitoring & logging** – Detecting anomalies in model behavior.
- **Explainability tools** – To detect unusual reasoning patterns.

## Limitations
- No single defense is foolproof.
- Defense must be **layered** (defense-in-depth).
