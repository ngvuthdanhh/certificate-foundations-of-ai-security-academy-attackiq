# 📊 Threat Assessment – AI Security

## Overview
This report outlines the key AI-related threats covered in the course and their impact on enterprise environments.

## Key Threats
- **Data Poisoning** – Compromising training data integrity.
- **Evasion Attacks** – Crafting adversarial inputs to fool AI models.
- **Model Extraction** – Stealing proprietary models via queries.
- **Prompt Injection** – Manipulating LLMs to override safety.

## Risk Levels
| Threat              | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|---------------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data Poisoning      | Medium     | High   | 🔴 Critical |
| Evasion Attacks     | High       | High   | 🔴 Critical |
| Model Extraction    | High       | Medium | 🟠 Major    |
| Prompt Injection    | Very High  | High   | 🔴 Critical |

## Conclusion
AI systems must be integrated into **enterprise threat models**, as adversarial ML threats are no longer theoretical.
