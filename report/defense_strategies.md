# 🛡️ Defense Strategies for AI Security

## 1. Data Integrity
- Establish trusted data pipelines.
- Apply anomaly detection for mislabeled samples.
- Enforce provenance & data audits.

## 2. Robust Modeling
- Use adversarial training.
- Apply feature squeezing & defensive distillation.
- Build ensemble models.

## 3. API & Model Protection
- Query rate limiting.
- Output watermarking.
- Differential privacy for responses.

## 4. LLM-Specific Protections
- Prompt sanitization.
- Context isolation & sandboxing.
- Continuous red-teaming against prompts.

## 5. Organizational Measures
- Establish AI-specific incident response.
- Integrate AI risks into ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS or NIST AI RMF.
- Provide staff awareness & training.
